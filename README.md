## 🔍 Dashboard Visualizations & Insights
The dashboard is organized into four key sections to provide a holistic view of sales performance:

### 1. Total Sales by Category and Segment
A stacked horizontal bar chart visualizes total sales across product categories (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture) and breaks them down by customer segments (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).  
**Insight:** Technology and Office Supplies consistently generate the highest sales across all segments.

### 2. Total Sales and Profit Over Time
A dual-axis line chart illustrates annual Sales and Profit trends from 2011 to 2014, highlighting consistent year-over-year growth.

### 3. Profit by Country
An interactive map visual highlights profit distribution across Europe, enabling rapid identification of top-performing regions.

### 4. Best-Selling Products
A treemap visualization displays product-level performance, with the size of each block representing sales or profit magnitude.  
**Example:** “Nokia Smart Phone, Full Size” is identified as top-selling product.
